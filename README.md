                                                        **Loan Approval Prediction**

                                                           Problem Statement

Financial institutions manually evaluate thousands of loan applications every day, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and may lead to inconsistent approval decisions.
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning–based loan approval prediction system that automatically analyzes applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment status to predict whether a loan should be approved or rejected, ensuring faster, consistent, and data-driven decision-making.
